<p> Taking into account the latest epidemic development, the Education Bureau will make announcements on class suspension and resumption arrangements for all schools (including kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, special schools, and private schools offering non-formal curricula). Higher education institutions will also make announcements on their program arrangements. </p>

<h3>
    <strong>Activities</strong>
</h3>

<p>An EDB spokesman stated, "The EDB places significant attention to students' health and periodically reviews various anti-epidemic measures in schools. We will relax the requirements for students to wear masks during half-day activities like speech days, parents' days, open days, and campus visits in response to the government's earlier announcement that the second stage of the relaxation in social distance measures will be implemented today as scheduled. Students who attend the activities must still adhere to the venue's pertinent anti-epidemic prevention requirements. </p>
<p>Furthermore, secondary schools, elementary schools, and kindergartens can set up Saturday half-day participation in non-academic mask-wearing extracurricular activities (such as music or sports events, and school team practice).</p>
